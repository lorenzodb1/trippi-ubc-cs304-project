Notes for The Others, our CS304 group:

- Make sure you pull or place the project to XAMPP/htdocs

- Make sure you have intalled composer https://getcomposer.org into the project folder

- You might need to update PHP to 5.6 for composer to work properly when building certain libraries

- Once you have composer working, run php composer.phar install on the terminal

- Once you have XAMPP running with Apache, and MySQL running, you can run the app with http://localhost/*name of project folder*/public/
