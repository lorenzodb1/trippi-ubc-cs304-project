# ubc-cpsc304-project
notes for our 304 group:

make sure you pull or place the project to XAMPP/htdocs.

make sure you have intalled composer https://getcomposer.org into the project folder.

you might need to update you php to 5.6 for composer to work properly when building certain libraries.

once you have composer working run php composer.phar install

once you have xampp running with appache and mysql running you should be able to run the app with http://localhost/trippi304/public/
